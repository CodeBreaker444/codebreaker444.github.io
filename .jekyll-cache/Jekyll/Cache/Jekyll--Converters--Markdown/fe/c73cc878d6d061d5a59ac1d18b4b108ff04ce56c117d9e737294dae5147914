<p>The most obvious question in this world is why. Whether it is relative to put this in here or not but i donâ€™t care because i implement my rules as it is stated above. Iâ€™ll explain some questions which came into my mind when resuming(cbstartech.com was my previous blog) my blogging.</p>

<h2 id="why-blogging">Why blogging?</h2>

<p>I work when i find something interesting and completes it in 2 to 3 days and speaking frankly, I tend to enjoy when working on something rather than playing pubg more than 6hrs but i stick to playing pubg:). I play a lot even before pubg (i know this word seems more intimidating, for today let me call it time-killer). As i finish my projects early i obviously need time-killer, playing pc games on my rig(My custom water cooled pc - I didnâ€™t just call it a pc because water cooled looks more cool right and it makes me cool, i think so!) is a past because itâ€™s boring when compared to the online games(Exception for pc because i always play cracked games, donâ€™t start hating me yet!. Itâ€™s before 3years and i think you know the adrenaline when buying a PC which costs around 2L - 3000$). Sharing is caring is the word which travels through the internet and iâ€™d <del>love</del> like to use it here, instead of wasting my time in time-killer iâ€™ll start writing my ideas, hacks, problems and solutions but not limited to these. I heard something from you, Nope! i am not resuming my blog to earn money which i am less concerned about and i donâ€™t want to put more money on hosting. So, Iâ€™m running it with jekyll on github pages.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-work-on-something-else">Why not work on something else?</h2>

<p>Ofcourse, i am working on something else but tell me one thing, Doing the same thing everyday will make you happy or boredom(we are human beings right!). So, doing something useful to other people and as a bonus it will free up your mind(atleast for me) is goto thing. Teaching someone individually is a hell of, time taking process and iâ€™m pretty bad at it (Itâ€™s not beacause i canâ€™t, itâ€™s because i donâ€™t) and moreover if i like training or teaching someone iâ€™ll be in a training company or a professor in college.</p>

<h2 id="why-your-logo-looks-like-old-piece-of-st-to-some-people">Why your logo looks like old piece of s**t? To some peopleâ€¦.</h2>

<p>Stop calling it old! Itâ€™s not old, itâ€™s antique. We all know looks doesnâ€™t matter untill and unless it makes history and it keeps it glory untill I was alive and after that if it was not able to create history then you may call it s**t!. Logoâ€™s are so powerfull which can start a revolution and even a war. It symbolises the purpose of its existence and people may forget leaders but their logoâ€™s will crawl around the internet.</p>
