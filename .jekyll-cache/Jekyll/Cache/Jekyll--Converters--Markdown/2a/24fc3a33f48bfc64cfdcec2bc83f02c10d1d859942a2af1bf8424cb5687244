I"ô<p>This is an assessment writeup so, it will be short and in-depth. These writeups are written only after a patch has been released and only use it for educational purpose.</p>

<p>Before we get into details, there are few things to consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>No permanent damage is done to the platform code or to the servers.</li>
  <li>This vulnerability is already patched and donâ€™t waste your time in replicating it on heartynote.</li>
  <li>This is not a DDOS attack and i recommend you not to do it too.</li>
  <li>This writeup doesnâ€™t provide a step by step by instruction to hack anything but gives you the basic idea behind the approach.</li>
  <li>Last but not least this is only for educational purpose.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="approach">Approach:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Analysis (Mobile and Web platform which includes APIâ€™s).</li>
  <li>Finding a vulnerability (zero-day hack).</li>
  <li>Writing a payload (I have written a messy python script. It will be available in my github repo after cleaning the code a bit.).</li>
  <li>Optimize the payload and isolate it in a v-env (Ex: Use systemwide VPN, Force ip-spoof in the payload, I used threading for faster execution).</li>
  <li>Choosing a payload delivery method (I choose API endpoints to deliver the payload).</li>
  <li>Start the execution (BOOM!!!).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>I started identifying the platform they using which includes next.js and backend APIâ€™s some are written in python and some are in other languages(which doesnâ€™t matter excluding php). PHP is more vulnerable compared to these backend javascript frameworks such as express, next.js..etc. They are event based and are difficult to analyse and i did not choose the web platform because it is difficult to analyse the APIâ€™s there, so i went with the android platform. I used SSL-Unpinning to decrypt the json parameter and noted down the parameters and header names.</p>

<h3 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h3>
<p>No IP-Ratelimiting and No implementation reset code counter and the password reset code is a 4 digit number from 0 to 9 with a total possibilities of 10000 (104 ) combinations which opens a way for bruteforceing but with a different approach because itâ€™s not php .</p>

<h3 id="payload">Payload</h3>
<p>I was in a hurry and i donâ€™t really like the pre-built tools because of the absence of multi-threading which drastically reduces the time. So, i started writing a messy python script with the support of prallel processing controlled by a semaphore.(Easyyy!!took 30mins because of the multiple json parameters.) Burpsuite is a pain in the a** when dealing mobile apps operating with SSL and From 7.0 nougat android doesnâ€™t trust user installed C.A certificates.</p>

<h3 id="optimising--isolation">Optimising &amp; Isolation</h3>
<p>Find combinations recursively takes time. So,i have written a simple but elegant non-recursive algo and wrapped in a definition and forced IP-address to be 00:00:00:00:00:00, System wide VPN enabled!!.</p>

<h3 id="delivery-method">Delivery Method</h3>
<p>API endpoints</p>

<h3 id="execution">Execution</h3>
<p>python3 bruteforcer.py (I am so lazy that i hardcoded the required parameters into the code itself.)</p>

<h3 id="result">Result</h3>
<p>Within two minutes i have compromised the Heartynote Founders Account.</p>

<p>ğŸ“„ğ’©â„´ğ“‰â„¯: Assessment of commercial companies requires a certification such as Certified Ethical Hacker(Not limited to CEH) but for personal tests not at all needed, go ahead. There are so many things i have not listed because the more you go the more it comes visible in this path. Find your own way and your own approach. Happy Hacking!!!!</p>
